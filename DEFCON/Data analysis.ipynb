    "\n",
    "Military conflict is an intense state of violence. In such situations, it is crucial for a nation to stay alert, cope with it, and mitigate its implications. A country has set up the DEFCON (Defense Readiness Condition) warning system. This alert system is used to gauge the level of alertness of the defense forces. It consists of five levels of readiness for the military forces to be prepared for the consequences of the conflict. The DEFCON system allows the nationâ€™s forces to be a step ahead of its rivals.\n",

    "You are given a synthesized data that can be used to build a model that can accurately predict the DEFCON level raised as a result of the conflict."
